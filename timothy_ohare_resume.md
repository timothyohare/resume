# Professional Experience

## Principal Advisor – mine automation system | Rio Tinto | 2011 – 2014

Manage a team of senior automation and software engineers. Liaise, direct and coordinate partner universities, product group stakeholders, operators and third party vendors.

### Mine Automation System

- Fused disparate sources of information spread across multiple data silos and OEM systems. Consolidated in to a coherent real time 3D view of the mine. Providing geologists with the necessary information to identify high grade ore that was previously missed. Consistently identifying 10 kt of extra ore per month providing $1 million of extra revenue per month.
- Autonomously controlled an OEMs heavy mobile equipment (blast hole drill) using a standard interface and protocol. Demonstrating a system that could integrate and autonomously control fit for purpose equipment from any OEM.
- Applied research from university partners to projects which delivered quantifiable value for multiple business units. One project predicted the top of the coal seam to minimise drill through. This saved 5% from the top of a coal seam being contaminated with blast debris, resulting in over $20 million in savings per year.

### Software Engineering Process – Continuous Improvement

Analyse the team's software development lifecycle processes and create a strategy and roadmap for continuous improvement including:

- Agile SCRUM Practices
- Static analysis and code review
- Continuous integration and testing
- Configuration and deployment management

Achieved a tightly integrated team which delivered complex software that could be distributed and supported across eight mine sites and four commodities (Iron Ore, Coal, Copper, Borates). By following SCRUM and being Agile we were able to deliver new and improved features in the product at the end of every sprint (three weeks). Code review, static analysis, continuous integration and testing baked in quality and removed design, logic and coding errors early in the software development life cycle. Configuration and deployment management provided consistent, repeatable, automated deployment of the product to customers.

### ISO Standards Committee

Represented Rio Tinto on the ISO [17757](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=60473) "Earth Moving Machinery - Autonomous Machine Safety" Technical Committee. Achieved a framework for autonomous machine safety.

### Smart Charge Truck

A set of automationapplications to provide Drill and Blast Engineers access to the explosives delivery trucks past, present and planned future operation at mine sites across the Pilbara.

Provided sophisticated explosive recipe recalculation based on the latest geological information, there by using the correct amount and type of explosive for the specific geology.

Achieved a saving of over $1 million per year in reduced explosives usage and reduced oversize ore entering the crusher.

## TEAM LEADER – SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT |PTS |2007 – 2011

PTS (Patrick Technology Services) provides automation services to Patrick, the largest stevedore in Australia. The container port in Brisbane is automated with twenty three [AutoStrads](http://www.patrick.com.au/brisbane-autostrad-terminal/w1/i1001395/) moving containers with in the yard autonomously.

As a team lead, I led a team of six.

### Yard Management System (YMS)

- Manages the optimal placement and tracking of containers in the yard and refrigerated zones. A C++, Perl, multi-threaded, shared memory and TCP/TP networked application running on Linux. Provided statistics and information on a HTML page using XML/XSLT and RRDTool
- Provided system design and development, liaised with stakeholders and customers, managed milestone adherence and reporting
- Exceeded the KPI for reduced container movements in the terminal (2.2), reduced the time of an allocation from 6 seconds to sub second. Increased the container movements per shift from 90 to 240.

### Terminal Operations GUI

- A 3D real time view and operator interface of the container terminal. C++, QT Toolkit & OpenGL on Windows utilising TCP/IP networking to a Linux server.
- Lead a team of six producing the new GUI from inception
- Closely worked with the terminal management and users
- Exceeded targets and requirements in functionality, visualisation, accuracy, yard fault identification and rectification. 

### Senior Software Engineer |Infostream |2004 – 2007

### Financial data feed delivery to mobile devices

- The data feed processes, prioritises and compresses financial data from Reuters to be delivered to mobile devices. Migrated the backend processes from a disparate set of windows applications and systems to an industrial Linux application.
- Achieve an uptime improvement from 70% to 99.9%.

### Customer Account Management

- Transformed a poorly performing existing customer management application from ASP and Microsoft Access to Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL 
- Achieved faster performance (1 min -> 5 second updates) and significantly increased uptime
